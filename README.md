Discourse Puppet File
=====================

This is not working. Yet. Still need to complete a few steps. I am aim to provide a single click solution to
install discourse on a blank ubuntu machine.

A puppet script to install Discourse (discourse.org) based on 
the instruction provided at the [official documentation](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-ubuntu.md)

This is tested on ubuntu 12.04 x64

How to use
----------
1. ./bootstrap.sh
2. ./run.sh

Bootstrap script will install puppet, and the run script is to use puppet to set up discourse.
